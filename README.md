# 🧠 Home Assistant Blueprints by John Stetter

Welcome to my curated collection of Home Assistant blueprints, designed for power users, smart home nerds, and anyone who appreciates finely-tuned automation.

These blueprints are written with clarity, flexibility, and real-world usability in mind — optimized for people with mobility considerations and adapted lighting needs (but work great for anyone).
