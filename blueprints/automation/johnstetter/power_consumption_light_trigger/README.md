# üé∂ Turntable Lamp Automation with Adaptive Lighting & Notification

**Let your lamp follow your vinyl.**  
This Home Assistant **Blueprint** automatically fades in your lamp when your record player is spinning, adapts lighting to the time of day, and warns you if you forget to stop the music.

## Features

- **Fade-in/fade-out:** Smooth transitions for lamp on/off.

- **Forgetful-proof:** Sends a voice alert and turns the lamp red if the turntable runs too long.
- **All options UI-configurable:** No YAML wrangling needed after setup.
